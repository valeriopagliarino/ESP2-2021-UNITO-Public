**List of experiments (electrotechnics):**
1. Internal resistance of digital and analogic voltmeters and ammeters, study of the I(V) function of a bulb including comparison with black-body radiation law.
2. Characterization of an oscilloscope, study of the hysteresis loop of a transformer at low frequency, study of the gain of a RC passive integrator.
3. Characterization of RC filters as high cut, low cut, integrator, differentiator.
4. Characterization of second order RCL filters. Response to variable frequency, evaluation of bandwidth, their use as step-up or step-down converters.
5. Study of PN junction, characterization of I(V) function for silicon diodes and LEDs. Solid state rectifiers and regulators.
6. Study of NPN junction, input and output characteristic of NPN BJTs in common-emitter configuration. Solid state amplifiers.
